//! Explicit `COLLATE` operator inside `IN`, `CASE`, and `BETWEEN`, matched to
//! the `sqlite3` CLI (3.50.4). A direct `=` already honored `COLLATE` on either
//! side; these comparison-bearing constructs did not.
//!
//! SQLite's quirks, verified against the CLI:
//!  - `IN`: a single-element list behaves like `x = y` (the element's `COLLATE`
//!    applies), but a multi-element list uses the *left* operand's collation
//!    only — per-element `COLLATE` is ignored there.
//!  - `CASE x WHEN y`: each `WHEN` is an independent comparison, honoring an
//!    explicit `COLLATE` on that `WHEN` (or on the base `x`).
//!  - `BETWEEN`: each bound comparison honors a `COLLATE` on that bound.
